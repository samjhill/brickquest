# 🧪 Virtual Playtest v2 - Issues Found

## 🔴 Critical Issues

### 1. HP Values Not Updated in Simulation ✓
**Problem**: Simulation shows HP 20/21, 20/20 instead of new values 15/16  
**Evidence**: All players start at HP 20+  
**Location**: `playtest_simulation.js` line ~618  
**Fix Required**: Update `createPlayer` method to use HP 15/16

### 2. Energy Debt Issue Persists ✓
**Problem**: Energy restored: 0 → 5 (should never go to 0)  
**Evidence**: "Energy restored: 0 → 5" in turn 8  
**Location**: Simulation engine allows energy to reach 0  
**Fix Required**: Update energy restoration to prevent going below 0

### 3. Turn Count Mismatch ✓
**Problem**: Shows "Total turns: 3" but actually played 8 turns  
**Evidence**: Summary says 3 turns, but we saw 8 turns of play  
**Location**: Turn counter logic  
**Fix Required**: Debug turn counting in simulation

## ⚠️ Moderate Issues

### 4. Hand Size Not Enforced ✓
**Problem**: Players have varying hand sizes (1-3 cards)  
**Evidence**: Some players with 1 card, others with 3  
**Expected**: All players should have max 5 cards  
**Fix Required**: Enforce hand size limit in simulation

### 5. Low Engagement Between Players ✓
**Problem**: Limited combat interactions across 8 turns  
**Evidence**: Only 2-3 attacks total in 8 turns  
**Impact**: Game feels slow/defensive  
**Suggestion**: Increase aggression in AI or adjust encounter rate

## 🔧 Required Fixes

### High Priority
1. **Update HP values in simulation** - Change base HP to 15/16
2. **Fix energy debt prevention** - Ensure energy never goes below 0
3. **Enforce hand size limit** - Maximum 5 cards

### Medium Priority
4. **Increase combat frequency** - More aggressive AI
5. **Fix turn counter** - Accurate reporting

## 📈 Expected vs Actual

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Starting HP | 15/16 | 20/21 | ❌ Wrong |
| Energy debt | Prevented | Allowed | ❌ Wrong |
| Hand size | Max 5 | 1-3 | ⚠️ Inconsistent |
| Combat frequency | High | Low | ⚠️ Needs work |
| Game length | 7-10 turns | 8 turns | ✅ OK |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Update `playtest_simulation.js` with new HP values
2. Fix energy system to prevent debt
3. Implement hand size limit in simulation
4. Re-run playtest to validate fixes
5. Adjust AI aggression for better gameplay
