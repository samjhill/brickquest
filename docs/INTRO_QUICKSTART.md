# 🧱 BrickQuest: Welcome to the Future of Tactical Gaming

## 🌟 Welcome, Hero Automaton!

Welcome to **BrickQuest**—where tactical card combat, LEGO building, and strategic thinking collide in the most unique tabletop experience you'll ever play.

In the year 2157, the Quantum Network collapsed, leaving behind only the sentient Automatons. You control one of these heroes, each with unique abilities, as you battle across dynamic LEGO battlefields using cards and wits. Build structures, upgrade your robot, and dominate the battlefield!

## 🎯 What Makes BrickQuest Special?

### 🧱 **Hybrid Tabletop + LEGO Building**

### 🤖 **Four Unique Character Classes**
- **🔧 Engineer**: Master of construction and defense
- **⚔️ Warrior**: Unstoppable combat specialist  
- **⚡ MageCore**: Energy manipulation and power
- **🎭 Trickster**: Mobility and tactical positioning

### ⚔️ **Fast-Paced Strategic Combat**
Plan your moves carefully. Every energy point, every card, every movement matters in this tactical skirmish.
