## üß± Brick Economy System

### Core Concept
Every player gets a small pile of physical Lego bricks at the start of combat. The bricks themselves are the resource - no digital tracking needed!

### Starting Setup
- **2-3 players**: 6 bricks each, 50 in shared pool
- **4-5 players**: 4 bricks each, 70 in shared pool  
- **6+ players**: 3 bricks each, 100 in shared pool

### Turn Integration
At the start of each turn:
- **Gain +2 Energy** (tracked digitally)
- **Gain +2 Bricks** (physically from shared pool)

### Brick Usage
During Action Phase, spend bricks to:
- Build structure cards
- Add to existing builds
- Create cover, bridges, traps
- Upgrade turrets/platforms
- Any unused bricks stay in your personal pile

### Shared Brick Pool
- Keep one container of bricks in the middle of the table
- When structures are destroyed, bricks return to the pool
- If pool runs out, no one gains more until bricks are freed
- This creates natural terrain scarcity

### Brick Cap (Optional)
- Soft cap = 8 bricks per player
- If over cap at start of turn, don't take more
- Players can trade bricks by passing them across the table

### Structure Cost Cards
- Print build costs directly on cards
- "Wall ‚Äî 4 bricks"
- "Turret ‚Äî 6 bricks"
- All structures use standard bricks (no special pieces required)

### Brick Destruction & Refunds
- **Destroyed in combat**: All bricks return to shared pool
- **Dismantled voluntarily**: Half bricks (rounded down) return to pool
- **Collapsed from events**: None or partial, per card/GM ruling

## üèóÔ∏è Building System

### Lego Integration
- Use standard Lego plates and bricks
- All terrain pieces have Lego-compatible connection points
- Build custom structures during the game
- Structures provide tactical advantages

- **HP**: 4 (increases with modules)

#### Module Types
- **Defense Module**: +3 Defense to adjacent units
- **Weapon Module**: Ranged attack (3 damage, 2 range)
- **Utility Module**: +1 Energy per turn to adjacent units

#### Building Rules
1. **Placement**: Modules must be adjacent to Modular Base
2. **Requirements**: Each module requires an existing Modular Base
