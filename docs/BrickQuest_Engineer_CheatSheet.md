## ⚙️ Engineer Strategy Tips

### Energy Management
- Use **Build Structure** action to save energy on constructions
- **Overcharge Systems** when you have 2+ structures on field
- **Emergency Repair** for critical structure maintenance

### Building Priority
1. **Modular Base** - Foundation for upgrades
2. **Defense Module** - Defensive positioning
3. **Weapon Module** - Area control and damage
4. **Utility Module** - Energy support
5. **Fortress Complex** - Major defensive position

### Tactical Positioning
- Build structures to control key chokepoints
- Use **Overcharge Systems** before major combat
- **Emergency Repair** can target enemy structures for sabotage

## 🛠️ Brick Economy (Engineer Focus)

**Starting Bricks**: 6 bricks (2-3 players) / 4 bricks (4-5 players)

**Turn Income**: +2 bricks per turn

**Building Costs**:
- **Modular Base**: 5 bricks (3E → 2E with Engineer)
- **Modules**: 4 bricks each (3E → 2E with Engineer)
- **Fortress Complex**: 12 bricks (4E → 3E with Engineer)

**Destruction**: All bricks return to shared pool
