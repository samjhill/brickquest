# BrickQuest Cheat Sheet Icons

This directory contains icon assets for the BrickQuest cheat sheet.

## Icon System

The cheat sheet uses emoji-based icons that are universally supported and render well in both color and black & white printing. All icons are sourced from the Unicode emoji standard and are defined in the main ICON_MAP.md file.

## Icon Usage

Icons are embedded directly in the markdown content using emoji characters. This approach ensures:

- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Works in both color and B&W printing
- ✅ Scales properly at different sizes
- ✅ Consistent rendering across devices
