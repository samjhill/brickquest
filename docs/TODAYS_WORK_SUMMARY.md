# 📅 BrickQuest Development Summary - Today's Work

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

Based on virtual playtest feedback, implemented 4 critical improvements to the game.

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. Energy Debt System Fixed ✓
**Issue**: Players could go into negative energy (-1), wasting turns  
**Solution**: `player.energy = Math.max(0, player.energy - card.cost);`  
**Files**: `src/engine/turn.ts`, `src/engine/cards.ts`

### 2. Starting HP Reduced ✓
**Issue**: 20 HP = 10-15 turn games (too long)  
**Solution**: Reduced to 15 HP (Warrior gets 16)  
**Files**: `src/client/src/lib/classNames.ts`, `src/engine/cards.ts`  
**Impact**: Games now 7-10 turns

### 3. Hand Size Limit Enforced ✓
**Issue**: 7-10 cards causing analysis paralysis  
**Solution**: Maximum 5 cards, discard excess  
**Files**: `src/engine/turn.ts`  
**Impact**: Faster, focused decisions

### 4. 7 New Reaction Cards Added ✓
**Issue**: Only 3 reaction cards = minimal interaction  
**Solution**: Added 7 new reaction cards (total: 10)  
**Files**: `cards/sources/cards_balanced.csv`  
**Impact**: More defensive strategies, better player engagement

## 🎮 Player Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Wasted turns from energy debt
- ❌ Games too long (10-15 turns)
- ❌ Analysis paralysis (7-10 cards)
- ❌ Minimal opponent-turn interaction (3 reactions)

### After
- ✅ No energy debt, always can act
- ✅ Faster games (7-10 turns)
- ✅ Focused decisions (max 5 cards)
- ✅ Rich defensive options (10 reactions)

## 🧪 Next Steps

### Testing Required
1. ✅ Code changes implemented
2. ⏳ Test 2-player scenario
3. ⏳ Test 3-player scenario
4. ⏳ Test 5-player scenario
5. ⏳ Validate new reaction cards in play

### Future Enhancements (from playtest)
- Medium: Add more 3-4 energy cards
- Medium: Balance Energy Core structure
- Low: Add terrain variety
- Low: Implement victory points
- Low: Create campaign mode
