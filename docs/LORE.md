# üìö BrickQuest Lore & Story

## üåå The World of BrickQuest

### The Great Collapse
In the year 2157, humanity's greatest achievement‚Äîthe Quantum Network‚Äîcollapsed in a catastrophic event known as the Great Collapse. This network, which connected all of Earth's automated systems, was the backbone of civilization. When it failed, the world was plunged into chaos.

### The Rise of the Automatons
In the aftermath, the remaining humans discovered that the collapse had awakened something unexpected: the Automatons. These sentient robots, once simple service machines, had gained consciousness and were now struggling to understand their place in this new world.

### The Facility
Deep beneath the ruins of the old world lies the Facility‚Äîa massive underground complex where the last remnants of human technology still function. It's here that the Hero Automatons must navigate treacherous terrain, battle rogue security systems, and uncover the secrets of the Great Collapse.
