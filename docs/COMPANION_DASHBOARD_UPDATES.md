  - Program installation
  - Movement
  - Combat
  - Special abilities

### **End Phase**
- **Description**: "Reset energy to maximum, process active programs, check win conditions"
- **Purpose**: Turn cleanup and effect processing

## üéÆ Updated Card Type Information

### **Action Cards**
- **Energy Range**: 1-4 energy (updated from 1-3)
- **Purpose**: Movement, attack, defend, repair

### **Structure Cards**
- **Energy Range**: 2-4 energy (updated from 2-5)
- **Purpose**: Create physical objects with Lego building

### **Program Cards**
- **Energy Range**: 2-4 energy (updated from 1-3)
- **Duration**: 2-3 turns
- **Purpose**: Give temporary AI to your robot

### **Reaction Cards** (New Section)
- **Energy Range**: 1-2 energy
- **Purpose**: Speed-play during other players' phases

### **Loot & Upgrade Cards**
- **Energy Cost**: 0 energy (unchanged)
- **Purpose**: Permanent improvements found as rewards

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è New Movement System Section

### **Basic Movement**
- **Cost**: 1 Energy per tile moved
- **Simplification**: Linear energy-to-movement ratio

### **Movement Stats by Class**
- **Engineer/Warrior**: 2 tiles
- **Mage Core**: 3 tiles  
- **Trickster**: 4 tiles

### **Restrictions**
- Cannot move through enemy spaces (except Trickster)
- Terrain may affect movement costs

## ‚öîÔ∏è New Combat System Section

### **Melee Attack**
- **Range**: Adjacent only
- **Damage**: Equal to attack stat

### **Ranged Attack**
- **Range**: 2-3 tiles
- **Damage**: Attack stat -1

### **Hit Mechanics**
- **Base Hit Chance**: 80%
- **Cover Effect**: Reduces accuracy by 20%
- **Simplified**: No complex line of sight calculations

## üîç Validation

### **No Linting Errors**
All updated files pass TypeScript linting without errors.

### **Consistent Interface**
The companion dashboard now accurately reflects the simplified game rules:
- ‚úÖ 3 phases instead of 6
