- Linear energy-to-movement ratio
- Easier to calculate and plan
- More predictable movement costs

**Benefits**:
- Intuitive movement rules
- Easier energy planning
- Consistent with other 1E actions
- Reduced decision paralysis

### 3. **Simplified Combat System**
**Before**: Complex accuracy calculations, line of sight, multiple damage types
**After**: Simple hit check with terrain modifiers

**Changes**:
- Removed line of sight calculations
- Simplified accuracy to 80% base + terrain modifiers
