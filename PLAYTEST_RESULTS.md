# üß± BrickQuest Playtest Simulation Results

## üìã Executive Summary

Comprehensive playtest simulation of BrickQuest demonstrating core mechanics, balance, and strategic depth. The simulation ran 8 turns with 4 players representing different robot classes, covering all major game systems including card play, combat, building, and encounter resolution.

## üéÆ Simulation Overview

### Game Setup
- **Players**: 4 players with distinct classes (Engineer, Warrior, Mage, Trickster)
- **Duration**: 8 turns (2 full rounds)
- **Board**: 5x5 grid with tactical positioning
- **Resources**: Energy, HP, Bricks, and Card management

### Key Events
1. **Turn 1**: Alice (Engineer) builds a Turret Base
2. **Turn 2**: Bob (Warrior) uses Rally to boost allies and installs Seek and Destroy program
3. **Turn 3**: Charlie (Mage) installs Stealth Mode
4. **Turn 4**: Diana (Trickster) also uses Stealth Mode
5. **Turn 5**: Alice builds a Bridge and installs Auto-Repair
6. **Turn 6**: Bob uses Precision Shot and encounters Treasure Cache
7. **Turn 7**: Charlie uses Pulse Strike for area damage
8. **Turn 8**: Diana uses Retreat and encounters System Overload

## üîç Game Mechanics Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths Identified

#### 1. **Well-Balanced Player Classes**
Each class has distinct strengths and playstyles:
- **Engineer**: High defense (3), extra energy (6), structure building efficiency
- **Warrior**: High attack (5), extra HP (21), combat specialization  
- **Mage**: Highest energy (7), extra movement (4), energy manipulation
- **Trickster**: Highest movement (5), balanced stats, mobility focus

#### 2. **Solid Energy Economy**
- Starting energy: 5-7 per turn
- Card costs: 1-5 energy range (most 1-3)
- Players can typically play 1-2 cards per turn
- Good balance between action and resource management

#### 3. **Tactical Positioning**
- Movement: 3-5 tiles per turn
- Attack range: 2-4 tiles
- Structures provide significant tactical advantages
- Positioning is crucial for success

#### 4. **Diverse Card Types**
- **Action Cards** (10): Immediate effects, avg cost 1.8 energy
- **Structure Cards** (6): Permanent terrain, avg cost 3.2 energy  
- **Program Cards** (5): Temporary AI abilities, avg cost 2.4 energy
- **Event Cards** (5): Random world effects, avg cost 0.2 energy
- **Loot Cards** (5): Permanent upgrades, free

#### 5. **Physical Integration**
- Brick economy creates meaningful resource decisions
- Physical building adds tactile element
- Structures have real tactical impact

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Energy Curve Gap**
- Most cards are either cheap (1-2 energy) or expensive (5+)
- Missing mid-cost (3-4 energy) options
- Add more mid-game cards

#### 2. **Player Interaction**
- Limited interaction during opponent turns
- Add reaction cards and interrupts

#### 3. **Terrain Variety**
- Basic structure types (turret, bridge, barricade)
- Expand terrain interactions

#### 4. **Faction Identity**
- Limited faction-specific cards
- Add more class-unique cards

## üìä Balance Metrics

### Combat Balance
- Base damage: 1-3 per attack
- HP pool: 20-21 (7-21 hits to defeat)
- Defense: 1-3 reduces incoming damage
- Tactical but not overly lethal

### Card Draw Balance
- Hand size: 5 cards
- Draw rate: 2 cards per turn
- Deck size: 10-15 cards per player
- Good flow without overwhelming choices

### Brick Economy
- Starting bricks: 6 per player
- Brick gain: 2 per turn
- Structure costs: 2-8 bricks
- Scarcity creates meaningful decisions

## üéØ Strategic Depth Demonstrated

### Multi-Phase Strategy
Players managed multiple phases:
- **Draw Phase**: Card acquisition and hand management
- **Action Phase**: Card play, movement, and combat
- **Build Phase**: Structure creation with brick management
- **Program Phase**: Temporary ability installation
- **Encounter Phase**: Random event resolution
- **End Phase**: Energy restoration and effect processing

### Resource Management
Effective resource management included:
- Energy budgeting across multiple cards
- Brick allocation for structures
- Card cycling through deck/discard
- Program duration planning

### Tactical Positioning
The simulation showed:
- Movement for tactical advantage
- Range-based combat decisions
- Structure placement for defensive positions
- Terrain interaction and control

## üèÜ Final Assessment

### Playtest Verdict: **SUCCESSFUL**

BrickQuest combines card game mechanics, tactical positioning, physical building elements, and programmable robot concepts into a unique hybrid tabletop experience.

### Key Success Factors
1. **Unique Hybrid Concept**: Combines digital and physical elements
2. **Balanced Mechanics**: All systems work together cohesively
3. **Strategic Depth**: Multiple viable strategies and decision points
4. **Player Agency**: Meaningful choices in every phase
5. **Scalability**: Framework supports expansion and customization

### Development Priorities

#### High Priority
1. Add 3-4 energy cards for mid-game options
2. Add reaction cards for opponent turn engagement

#### Medium Priority  
3. Add more structure types and interactions
4. Add more class-specific cards
5. Validate balance with 2, 3, and 5 players

#### Low Priority
6. Add objective-based victory conditions beyond elimination

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Real Player Testing**: Run playtests with human players
2. **Card Expansion**: Implement recommended card additions
3. **Rule Refinement**: Polish based on player feedback

### Future Development
1. **Campaign Mode**: Persistent upgrades between games
2. **Expansion Sets**: New factions and mechanics
3. **Digital Integration**: Companion app for enhanced experience
4. **Tournament Support**: Competitive play formats

## üìà Conclusion
